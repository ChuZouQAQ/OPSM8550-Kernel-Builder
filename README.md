# OnePlus Snapdragon Kernel Builder

GitHub Actions pipeline for building selected OnePlus Snapdragon 7 Gen 3(SM7550),
8 Gen 1(SM8450), 8 Gen 2(SM8550), and 8 Gen 3(SM8650) kernels. The repository contains the build
pipeline, validation, packaging, and release automation; kernel sources are
resolved from upstream repositories at build time.

## Supported build profiles

The workflow exposes only device/source combinations that are intentionally
configured. This avoids late failures caused by selecting an incompatible SoC
and source independently.

The OnePlus 10T community source is intentionally labeled `ovaltine`; it is
not presented as a OnePlus 10 Pro source.

The Nord CE4 source project stores its SM7550/crow device support in
`sm8550`-named kernel and modules repositories and builds it with the Kalama
GKI fragments. The profile keeps the real `sm7550` device identity in release
metadata while resolving that upstream naming explicitly.

The LunarisOS OnePlus 11 profile follows the kernel source published in the
LunarisOS OTA metadata. Its maintainer kernel uses `lineage-23.2`, while its
matching external modules use the `los` branch; the resolver pins both branches
independently and records both exact commits in the build provenance.

Every package accepts both its custom-ROM codename and the device-specific
stock board IDs published by the corresponding device tree. Generic SoC board
names such as `taro`, `kalama`, and `pineapple` are deliberately excluded so a
package cannot pass the check merely because another phone shares its chipset.
The check remains enabled, and a rejected flash prints all four device values
reported to AnyKernel so a genuinely missing regional alias can be diagnosed
safely.

## Build modes

`Build OnePlus Kernel` offers three modes:

- `Patch/config validation only` clones exact upstream revisions, applies the
  selected KernelSU/KPM/SUSFS/NoMount integration, verifies the final config,
  and smoke-compiles the affected KPM, SUSFS, VFS, proc, reboot, and NoMount
  objects without spending time on a full kernel compile.
- `Full build (artifact only)` builds and uploads a 14-day workflow artifact.
  This is the default and does not create a permanent GitHub Release.
- `Full build and publish release` builds the same verified artifact, then a
  separate least-privilege job publishes the release.

## Root integrations

Available workflow presets:

| Preset | Integration | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `No root changes` | No root integration | Baseline |
| `Official KernelSU` | Official KernelSU | Supported |
| `KernelSU-Next` | KernelSU-Next | Supported |
| `KernelSU-Next + SUSFS` | KernelSU-Next with SUSFS | Supported |
| `KowSU` | KowSU | Supported |
| `SukiSU Ultra + KPM (experimental)` | SukiSU Ultra with KPM | Experimental |
| `SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS + KPM (experimental)` | SukiSU Ultra with SUSFS and KPM | Experimental |
| `ReSukiSU` | ReSukiSU | Supported |
| `ReSukiSU + susfs` | ReSukiSU with SUSFS | Supported |
| `ReSukiSU + SUSFS + NoMount (experimental)` | ReSukiSU with SUSFS and NoMount | Experimental |

KPM is available only through the dedicated SukiSU Ultra presets because current
ReSukiSU no longer supports it. The pipeline resolves SukiSU Ultra to an exact
`main` commit, checks its KPM sources and Kbuild wiring, and enables `CONFIG_KPM`,
`CONFIG_KALLSYMS`, and `CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL`. The combined preset additionally
resolves and applies the matching SUSFS branch at an exact commit. Validation
mode compiles the KPM and SUSFS integration objects and checks their exported
signatures; a full build repeats the signature checks against the final kernel
artifacts. Both paths fail closed when expected wiring, config, objects, or
symbols are missing.

SUSFS branches are selected from the SoC and Android/kernel branch. Known vendor
include drift and the current SukiSU Ultra UTS-spoof/KPM resolver drift are
repaired only for explicitly recognized conflicts. The compatibility check keeps
the KPM symbol resolver linked and initialized after the SUSFS patch. Unknown
patch rejects fail closed and are included in diagnostics.

The KernelSU-Next + SUSFS preset resolves `pershoot/KernelSU-Next@dev-susfs`
to an exact commit. The regular KernelSU-Next preset remains on the official
`KernelSU-Next/KernelSU-Next@dev` branch. The compatibility branch is required
because the SUSFS KernelSU-side patch does not apply to the current official
development tree; the pipeline still takes the kernel-side SUSFS files and
patch from `simonpunk/susfs4ksu` at an exact commit.

SUSFS builds require upstream v2.2.0 or newer and explicitly verify the
`SUS_MAP` and `OPEN_REDIRECT` features in the final config. The NoMount preset
integrates the exact resolved `master` commit, enables `CONFIG_NOMOUNT=y`, and
checks both source wiring and final kernel signatures. NoMount hooks VFS
operations and is marked experimental by its upstream project, so it remains
an explicit opt-in instead of changing existing build presets.

## Quick start

1. Open `Actions` -> `Build OnePlus Kernel` -> `Run workflow`.
2. Select one device/source profile.
3. Keep automatic branch and Clang selection unless testing a known branch.
4. Select the root integration.
5. Start with `Patch/config validation only` after an upstream update, then run
   a full build when validation passes.
6. Use release mode only for an artifact you intend to keep or distribute.

Manually selected branch names are validated with Git before they are written
to GitHub Actions environment files. Every kernel, modules, root implementation,
SUSFS, NoMount, and AnyKernel input is resolved to an exact commit before cloning.

## Build performance

The full build passes `CC="ccache clang"` and host compiler wrappers directly
on every `make` invocation so Kbuild cannot replace the ccache launcher.
Build timestamps, user, and host metadata are deterministic for a given kernel
commit, which improves repeat-build cache hits.

The workflow also:

- clones kernel and modules repositories in parallel at exact commits
- caches the exact pinned AOSP Clang archive
- restores a profile/branch/compiler-specific 3 GB compressed ccache
- reports config, compile, total time, and ccache statistics in the job summary
- uses an adaptive 8/16 GB swap file with low swappiness for full builds

GitHub cache entries are an optimization only. A build remains able to download
or regenerate every cached input.

## Safe packaging and provenance

Generated AnyKernel3 ZIPs enable `do.devicecheck=1` and contain only the
device-specific codenames and stock board IDs assigned to the selected profile.
Android version checking is also enabled when the selected branch identifies a
known Android generation.

Each full build produces `release-assets/` containing:

- a device-checked AnyKernel3 ZIP
- a uniquely named raw `Image`
- `build-info.json` with all exact source commits, the KPM enabled state, and
  the workflow run URL
- `SHA256SUMS`
- generated `release-notes.md`

GitHub Actions uploads these release-ready files as one flat package artifact.
Build logs and configuration are kept in a separate diagnostics artifact,
along with `kpm-source-proof.txt` and `kpm-proof.txt` when KPM is selected (and
equivalent SUSFS/NoMount proofs for those presets). The release job downloads
only the package artifact and verifies its checksums before publishing.

The same `build-info.json` is embedded in the flashable ZIP. Keep a known-good
stock boot image available and never flash a package whose device check does
not match the phone.

## CI security and reliability

The build job has read-only repository permissions and checkout credentials are
not persisted. External kernel Makefiles therefore do not run in a job holding
release write credentials. Release publication runs separately and receives
`contents: write` only after the build artifact succeeds.

Network Git operations use bounded retries. Release creation and asset uploads
are idempotent, time-limited, and retried, preventing a stalled upload from
holding the build runner indefinitely.

All third-party GitHub Actions are pinned to full commit hashes. AOSP Clang
archive URLs are pinned to exact Gitiles commits, and changing the downloader
invalidates the toolchain cache.

## Validation and upstream health

Pushes and pull requests run:

- Bash syntax checks
- ShellCheck at warning severity
- offline tests for all eleven profile mappings, root mappings (including
  KernelSU-Next + SUSFS and SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS + KPM), Clang selection,
  KPM configuration, SUSFS selection/version floor, NoMount selection/wiring,
  Android version inference, and workflow option synchronization
- actionlint for all workflow files

`Check upstream health` runs every Monday and can also be started manually. It
resolves exact commits for all eleven profiles, then runs a thirteen-job
smoke-test matrix: KernelSU-Next + SUSFS, SukiSU Ultra + SUSFS + KPM, and
ReSukiSU + SUSFS + NoMount are validated on representative SM7550, SM8450,
SM8550, and SM8650 sources, with an additional baseline validation for the
LunarisOS OnePlus 11 source.

## Important limitations

- A successful build does not prove that a kernel is safe for every firmware,
  region, or boot stack of the listed device.
- Community sources are not official OnePlus sources.
- Manual or unusual branches may disable Android version checking when their
  version cannot be inferred safely.
- This pipeline builds the raw GKI `Image`; it does not rebuild every vendor
  module or replace device-specific firmware.
- NoMount modifies VFS behavior and upstream labels it experimental. Test its
  dedicated preset on a recoverable device before distributing it.
- KPM dynamically patches kernel behavior at runtime. Treat both SukiSU Ultra
  presets as experimental and test them only on a recoverable device.
- Runtime performance tuning is intentionally left at upstream/vendor config
  defaults. Options such as KASAN, LTO mode, scheduler changes, and compiler
  optimization flags require device-specific boot, stability, power, and
  benchmark testing before becoming defaults.
